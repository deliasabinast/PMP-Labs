//1:
/***
 * We can notice that de error rate slowly decreases
 * Though, we can't know for sure what the error is, providing the fact that we're only using 100 samples 
 * 
 ***/

 //2:
 /***
  * If we were to change the for, as follows: for { i <- 10000 to 100000 by 10000 }
  * We can observe the same thing as before, not much of a difference
  * but the rule that the error decreases with the square root of the number of samples becomes more clear
